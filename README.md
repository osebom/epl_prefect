This repo is a test for a Prefect pipeline that loads new data into a BigQuery table from the Fantasy League API. To launch the pipeline, run **python file_name.py**, use the Prefect UI, or **prefect deployment run 'epl-flow/first_epl'** where epl-flow is the function name and first_epl is the name of the flow. 

An example of the output below:
